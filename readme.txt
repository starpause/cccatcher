PROBLEM: I'm a creative commons junkie and dj. Every day I collect a bunch of mp3 + jpg by hand, totaling an oppressive number of gigabytes.

SOLUTION: A shuffle-ish player that randomly exposes me to the latest treats, with easy access to delete tracks that hurt my ears and tag tracks I want to stick in a mix. 

CURRENT FEATURES:
* 128x128 always-on-top, semi-transparent window
* add mp3s to play by dragging them or folders onto the window
* double click to shuffle
* right click for menu: Star (put -dinoaids- in the file name), Delete (remove file), Pause, Quit
* window displays a random image from the folder that holds whatever mp3 is playing
* shift & double click to shuffle image
* when you quit the current song and position is stored, continues playback from that point on next boot.

PLANNED FEATURES:
* mp3gain files before playing them
* play an mp3 instantly by dragging it alone onto the window
